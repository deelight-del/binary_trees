# BINARY TREE

Binary Trees are abstract tree like data type
that uses and follow a hierarchical structure.

They can be used for accessing nodes in some
better time complexity, which makes them find use
in searching and sorting algorithms.

They can also be used to represent some kind of data
in some bifurcating structure.


## THE FOLLOWING ARE THE TASKS DONE:

[task 0](0-binary_tree_node.c): Creates a new node that can be attached to a tree.


[task 1](1-binary_tree_insert_left.c): Attaches a new node to the the left child node of a parent node.



[task 2](2-binary_tree_insert_right.c): Attaches a new node to the right child node of a parent node.


[task 3](3-binary_tree_delete.c): Deletes all the node of a tree.


[task 4](4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c): Tests if a given node is a leaf node or not.
